# InstantDeepslate

#### An extremely simple mod that allows you to instantly mine deepslate.

This works by changing the blast resistance and break time values for deepslate blocks using reflection. They are all changed to their closest stone counterpart block. On it's own, this mod will only work on singleplayer, but I have created a [paper plugin](https://github.com/bush-did-711/instantdeepslate-plugin) that allows this to work on servers.

If you have the fabric modmenu installed, you can enable/disable the functionality, but it does not save because I don't care enough.

This mod probably won't recieve any support, but it is so simple im sure anyone could figure out how to update it or add/remove blocks.
